# ECE5725-Smart-Trash-Can
make your life smarter 


Annoyed by the design of traditional trash cans where we need to open the lid ourselves even when our hands are full. We built a trash can that can "read the ownerâ€™s mind" and open the lid automatically. 

The trash can can detect the user's presense using sensors and opens its lid when the user is neary by. In addition, the trash can supports voice recognition. The user can also open or close the lid by telling it to "open" or "close". The trash can also has a status display that tells the owner whether it is empty, half full or full along with emoji displays based on its fullness. The fuller it gets, the unhappier the trash can will be. It can remind the user to take out the trash at the end of day if it gets full by sending the user an email. 

With the Raspberry pi, we turn the traditional trash can into a smart trash can and make life easier.
